## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests. It provides:
- RESTful API endpoints for all personalization services
- Authentication and authorization via Amazon Cognito
- Request validation and throttling
- API versioning and stage management

### 2. Lambda Functions

The application is built using a serverless architecture with the following Lambda functions:

#### Transaction Processing
- **TransactionProcessorFunction**: Processes financial transactions and updates user profiles.
- **AccountLookupFunction**: Retrieves account information for users.

#### Personalization Services
- **PersonalizationRecommenderFunction**: Generates personalized product recommendations.
- **EmbeddingGeneratorFunction**: Creates vector embeddings for products and user profiles.
- **UserBehaviorTrackerFunction**: Tracks user interactions and updates preference models.
- **NextBestActionFunction**: Determines the next best financial actions for users.

### 3. DynamoDB Tables

The application uses several DynamoDB tables for data storage:

- **UserPreferencesTable**: Stores user preference data for personalization.
- **UserBehaviorTable**: Tracks user interactions and behaviors.
- **ProductCatalogTable**: Contains information about financial products.
- **TransactionTable**: Stores transaction data.
- **AccountTable**: Contains account information.

### 4. OpenSearch Service

The OpenSearch Service provides vector search capabilities for finding similar products and recommendations:

- Stores product embeddings for similarity search
- Enables semantic search across product descriptions
- Supports hybrid search combining keywords and vector similarity

### 5. Amazon Bedrock (Mock Implementation)

The platform uses embedding models for text representation:

- Generates embeddings for user profiles and financial products
- Enables semantic matching between user needs and product offerings
- Currently implemented as a mock service for development

### 6. DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)

DAX provides caching for DynamoDB to improve performance:

- Reduces read latency for frequently accessed data
- Improves throughput for read-heavy workloads
- Seamless integration with DynamoDB API

## Data Flow

### User Preference Collection
1. User interacts with the application
2. UserBehaviorTrackerFunction captures the interaction
3. Interaction is stored in UserBehaviorTable
4. User preferences are updated in UserPreferencesTable

### Recommendation Generation
1. Client requests personalized recommendations
2. PersonalizationRecommenderFunction retrieves user preferences
3. BedrockService generates embeddings for user profile
4. OpenSearchService finds similar products using vector search
5. Recommendations are returned to the client

### Next Best Action Determination
1. Client requests next best actions
2. NextBestActionFunction retrieves user data (preferences, behaviors, financial context)
3. Service analyzes financial indicators to generate recommendations
4. BedrockService generates embeddings for user profile
5. OpenSearchService finds relevant products for each recommendation
6. Prioritized actions with related products are returned to the client

## Service Implementations

### NextBestActionService

The NextBestActionService is responsible for determining the most appropriate financial actions for a user based on their profile and financial context. It:

1. Analyzes the user's financial situation (income, expenses, debt, savings, etc.)
2. Identifies areas for improvement or optimization
3. Generates actionable recommendations with confidence scores
4. Enriches recommendations with relevant financial products

The service implements several recommendation generators:
- Savings recommendations
- Debt management recommendations
- Investment recommendations
- Credit improvement recommendations

Each recommendation includes:
- A description of the recommended action
- Context explaining why the action is recommended
- A confidence score indicating the relevance of the recommendation
- Related financial products that can help implement the recommendation

### BedrockService (Mock Implementation)

The BedrockService is responsible for generating embeddings from text. In the current implementation:

- It provides a mock implementation that generates random embeddings
- The mock service maintains the same interface as the real service
- It can be replaced with a real implementation using Amazon Bedrock or another embedding service

### MockOpenSearchService

The MockOpenSearchService provides a simulated OpenSearch experience for development:

- Generates mock products based on search queries
- Simulates vector search functionality
- Maintains the same interface as the real OpenSearch service

## Data Models

### UserPreferences

The UserPreferences model stores user preference data for personalization:

- User ID
- Risk tolerance (1-5 scale)
- Investment horizon (e.g., "SHORT_TERM", "MEDIUM_TERM", "LONG_TERM")
- Preferred categories (list of product categories)
- Category preferences (map of categories to preference weights)
- Additional attributes (extensible key-value pairs)

### UserBehavior

The UserBehavior model tracks user interactions and behaviors:

- User ID
- Behavior ID
- Action type (e.g., "VIEW", "CLICK", "PURCHASE")
- Resource type (e.g., "SAVINGS", "INVESTMENT", "LOAN")
- Resource ID
- Timestamp
- Metadata (extensible key-value pairs)

### FinancialContext

The FinancialContext model represents a user's financial situation:

- User ID
- Monthly income
- Total savings
- Total debt
- Credit score
- Monthly expenses
- Disposable income
- Savings rate
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Accounts (list of financial accounts)
- Goals (list of financial goals)
- Additional attributes (extensible key-value pairs)

### FinancialProduct

The FinancialProduct model represents financial products that can be recommended:

- Product ID
- Product name
- Product type
- Description
- Category
- Tags
- Attributes
- Interest rate
- Annual fee
- Minimum deposit
- Maximum limit
- Risk level
- Eligibility criteria
- Benefits
- Requirements
- Created date
- Last updated
- Active status
- Embeddings (vector representation)

## Security Considerations

The platform implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Amazon Cognito for user authentication
   - IAM roles for service-to-service authentication
   - Fine-grained access control for DynamoDB tables

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption at rest for all data stores
   - Encryption in transit for all communications
   - Secure handling of sensitive financial information

3. **Network Security**:
   - API Gateway with WAF protection
   - VPC for internal services
   - Security groups for network isolation

4. **Compliance**:
   - Logging and monitoring for audit trails
   - Data retention policies
   - Privacy controls for user data

## Deployment and Operations

### Deployment

The application is deployed using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model):

1. Build the application:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   sam build
   ```
