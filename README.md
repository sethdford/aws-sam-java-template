# Enterprise Financial Services Serverless Application Template

This project provides a secure, compliant, and scalable template for building financial services applications on AWS using serverless architecture. It follows industry best practices for security, compliance, and performance.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

This template implements a serverless architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Secure API endpoints with WAF protection and Cognito authentication
- **Lambda Functions**: Java-based serverless functions for business logic
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing financial data with encryption at rest
- **Cognito**: User authentication and authorization with MFA
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for performance analysis

## Features

- **Security**: Implements financial industry security best practices
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit
  - Secure authentication with MFA
  - Fine-grained IAM permissions
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Audit logging

- **Compliance**: Designed with regulatory compliance in mind
  - Audit trails for all operations
  - Data retention policies
  - Secure data handling

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle varying workloads
  - Serverless architecture
  - Pay-per-use pricing model
  - No infrastructure management

- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Metrics for business and technical KPIs
  - Distributed tracing
  - Alerting capabilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Java 11 or later
- Maven

### Deployment

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourenterprise/aws-sam-financial-template.git
   cd aws-sam-financial-template
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```
   sam build
   ```

3. Deploy the application:
   ```
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to configure your deployment:
   - Stack Name: Your CloudFormation stack name
   - AWS Region: Region to deploy to
   - Environment: dev, test, stage, or prod
   - Confirm changes before deployment: Yes
   - Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles: Yes

### Testing

After deployment, you can test the API endpoints:

1. Get the API Gateway endpoint URL from the CloudFormation outputs:
   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <your-stack-name> --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='FinancialServicesApiEndpoint'].OutputValue" --output text
   ```

2. Create a user in the Cognito User Pool and obtain authentication tokens.

3. Test the account lookup endpoint:
   ```
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<env>/accounts/<account-id>
   ```

4. Test the transaction processing endpoint:
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" -d '{"accountId":"ACCT123456","amount":100.00,"transactionType":"DEPOSIT","description":"Initial deposit"}' https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<env>/transactions
   ```

## Customization

This template is designed to be customized for your specific financial services use case:

1. Modify the data models in `FinancialServiceFunction/src/main/java/com/enterprise/finance/model/`
2. Customize the business logic in the Lambda function handlers
3. Add additional API endpoints in the SAM template
4. Enhance security controls as needed for your specific compliance requirements

## Security Considerations

This template implements security best practices, but you should review and enhance security controls based on your specific requirements:

- Review IAM permissions and apply the principle of least privilege
- Consider adding additional WAF rules for your specific threat model
- Implement additional encryption for sensitive data fields
- Consider adding VPC integration for enhanced network security
- Implement additional authentication factors as needed

## Compliance

This template provides a starting point for building compliant financial applications, but you should review and enhance compliance controls based on your specific regulatory requirements:

- PCI DSS: For payment card processing
- SOX: For financial reporting
- GDPR/CCPA: For personal data protection
- Industry-specific regulations (e.g., FINRA, SEC)
